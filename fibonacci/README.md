## Fibonacci Algorithm

In this project there are four approaches of fibanacci algorithms:

1. Recursive Fibonacci, following the equation fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2), it results in a simple code but with low efficiency.
2. Recursive Fibonacci with memoization, using a Map data structure to store previous calculated results.
3. Sequential Fibonacci, this is the more efficient approach, however the code is more complex than the previous.
4. Generate Fibonacci sequence with a stream, it uses the sequential fibonacci algorithm, but using a stream to print each value of the sequence.
